# robots
As per instruction I should not spend more then 2-3 h I run out of time to refactor the code
as especially in main method for input validation  or creation of object (usage of factory pattern more like lack off)

to build the project you require to have maven and java8
    mvn clean install

main method exists in App.java

for the app to work input.txt file is required

make sure that you specify grid with 2 numbers with a space between them max value for a number is 50
5 3

creating a robot you need to put 2 numbers and String orientation (N/S/E/W) with a space between
1 1 E
Next line needs to be movement pattern with less then 100 characters long
